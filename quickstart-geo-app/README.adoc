gvNIX is a Spring Roo distribution that focuses both enterprise knowledge and 
enterprise standards to build Java applications.

If you don't know _What is gvNIX?_ you should start with https://github.com/DISID/gvnix-samples/tree/master/quickstart-app[quickstart-app] tutorial.

You must {download}[download], unpack and {installguide}[install] the 
development environment for gvNIX 1.5+, to be able to follow this guide.

The goal of this quick start geo app guide is to familiarize you with GEO apps generated using gvNIX. For this 
purpose, we will build an application based on https://github.com/DISID/gvnix-samples/tree/master/quickstart-app[quickstart-app] tutorial.

You can see an example of a *generated GEO web application* using gvNIX
http://geo-gvnix.rhcloud.com/login[here] (*user*: admin | *pass*: admin)

gvNIX uses http://www.leafletjs.com[Leaflet project] to generate map views. 

== Run from Git

If you want to preview this GEO sample application, follow this steps on the following order. If you prefer to develop by your own, go to https://github.com/DISID/gvnix-samples/tree/master/quickstart-geo-app#build-your-own-geo-app[gvNIX GEO Guide]

- Install http://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSql] and http://postgis.net/[PostGIS]
- Create new Database with name _postgis_example_. Use _gvnix_ as username and _gvnix_ as password.
- Add Postgis extensions on generated DB:

image:images/postgis_db.png[width="30%"]

- Clone github repository
[source, shell]
$ git clone https://github.com/DISID/gvnix-samples.git

- Acces to quickstart-geo-app
[source, shell]
$ cd quickstart-geo-app

- Execute application using maven:
[source, shell]
$ mvn clean compile tomcat7:run

- Open your browser on http://localhost:8080/petclinic/
- Access using _admin_ as username and _admin_ as password.

== Build your own geo app 	
 	
You can execute https://github.com/DISID/gvnix-samples/blob/master/quickstart-geo-app/quickstart-geo.roo[quickstart-geo.roo] file and creates a petclinic example application with GEO components. 	
 	
If you don't have experience using gvNIX, you can follow https://github.com/DISID/gvnix-samples/tree/master/quickstart-app#build-your-own-app[quickstart-app guide] and then follow this to generate additional GEO components and functionalities.

[[configure-persistence]] 	
== Configure Persistence 	
	
All DataBases are not valid to use Spatial Operations. 	
 	
That's why we need to configure our project with some valid Spatial DB. We can choose one of the following: 	
 	
- http://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSql] 	
- http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/overview/index.html[Oracle 10g/11g] 	
- http://www.mysql.com/[MySQL] 	
- http://www.microsoft.com/es-es/server-cloud/products/sql-server/[SqlServer] 	 	
 	
To follow this guide, you should configure a POSTGRES database on your system and add POSTGIS functionalities. To make that possible you can read http://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/[postgis documentation]. 	
 	
When you have a valid POSTGIS Database configured on your system, you can execute the following command with your database configuration: 	
 	
[source,shell] 	
jpa setup --provider HIBERNATE --database POSTGRES --userName USERNAME --databaseName DATABASENAME --password PASSWORD --hostName HOSTNAME 	
 	
 	
Now, you have your project configured to use a valid Spatial Database. 	
 	
[[add-spatial-suppot]] 	
== Add Spatial Support 	
 	
Your Database is configured to accept GEO types and GEO functionalities, but not your project. 	
 	
To do that, you need to configure your project persistence with some valid Spatial Provider like http://www.hibernatespatial.org[Hibernate Spatial]. 	
 	
Execute the following command on your gvNIX shell to add spatial support: 	
 	
[source,shell] 	
jpa geo setup --provider HIBERNATE_SPATIAL 	
	
NOTE: _This Spatial Provider is only available if your provider persistence is HIBERNATE and you select https://github.com/DISID/gvnix-samples/tree/master/quickstart-geo-app#configure-persistence[a valid DB]_ 	
 	
 	
[[add-geo-entity-fields]] 	
== Add Geo Entity Fields 	
 	
Now, you can add new fields to your generated Entites. (If you don't generate entities before you should check https://github.com/DISID/gvnix-samples/tree/master/quickstart-app#create-the-domain-entities[quickstart-app guide]) 	
 	
You can add some different field types: POLYGON, POINT, LINESTRING, MULTILINESTRING, GEOMETRY, etc... 	
 	
You should execute the following to add new fields on Owner entity: 	
 	
[source,shell] 	
field geo --fieldName location --type POINT --class ~.domain.Owner 	
field geo --fieldName distance --type LINESTRING --class ~.domain.Owner 	
field geo --fieldName area --type POLYGON --class ~.domain.Owner 	
 	
 	
NOTE: _Geo Field commands will not be available until you install Hibernate Spatial Provider._ 	
 	
 	
[[generate-geo-entity-finders]] 	
== Generate Geo Entity Finders 	
 	
To get GEO fields values on a map view we need to generate some different methods with Spatial functionalities. 	
 	
You can make it possible generating all finder methods for all entities with GEO fields. To do that, you need to execute the following command: 	
 	
[source, shell] 	
finder geo all 	
 	
On the other hand, if you want to generate finder methods of an specific entity with geo fields, you need to execute the following command: 	
 	
[source, shell] 	
finder geo add --class ~.domain.Owner 	
 	
NOTE: _If you execute finder geo add command on a entity that not has geo fields, you are going to get an error message._ 	
 	
 	


////
== Install Map View support
To add this funcionality you should have installed https://github.com/DISID/gvnix-samples/tree/master/quickstart-app#jquery[jQuery library] and https://github.com/DISID/gvnix-samples/tree/master/quickstart-geo-app#fancytree-component[Fancytree component] in your project. Then, you should execute the next command to include dependences and artifacts into your project:

[source, shell] 
web mvc geo setup
////

[[generate-map-views]] 	
== Generate Map Views 	
 	
You can generate all maps you want on your application. To do that, you need to execute the following commands: 	
 	
[source, shell] 	
web mvc geo controller --class ~.web.MapViewerController --preferredMapping mapview --projection EPSG4326 	
web mvc geo controller --class ~.web.MapController --preferredMapping map 	
 	
Previous commands generate different map views and different entries on top menu. The first map generated is configured with **_EPSG4326_** projection. By default all generated maps are generated with **_EPSG3857_** projection. 	
 	
image:images/menu.png[width="25%"] 	
image:images/simple_map.png[width="100%"] 	
 	
NOTE: _If you want to configure map options like zoom, center point, base layer, etc.. you need to edit manually your **views/{mappath}/show.jspx** file_ 	

[[use-map-control-on-cru]] 	
== Use Map Control on CRU 	
 	
At this step your project has https://github.com/DISID/gvnix-samples/tree/master/quickstart-geo-app#configure-persistence[a valid GEO Database], https://github.com/DISID/gvnix-samples/tree/master/quickstart-geo-app#add-spatial-support[Spatial Support configured], https://github.com/DISID/gvnix-samples/tree/master/quickstart-geo-app#add-geo-entity-fields[GEO fields on your entities] and https://github.com/DISID/gvnix-samples/tree/master/quickstart-geo-app#generate-geo-entity-finders[necessary finders]. 	
 	
Now, you are going to generate Map Controls on your CRU entity views (_create.jspx, show.jspx, update.jspx_) to create, display and update GEO fields values. 	
 	
To make that possible, you should execute the following commands: 	
 	
[source, shell] 	
web mvc geo field --controller ~.web.OwnerController --field location 	
web mvc geo field --controller ~.web.OwnerController --field distance 	
web mvc geo field --controller ~.web.OwnerController --field area 	
 	
 	
Now you can manage easly GEO fields values. 	
 	
NOTE: _If you don't apply this Map Components on CRU views, you need to use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text[WKT] on input fields to save valid values_ 

NOTE: _After you execute these commands, you will get a message informing that you need to specify a base layer for those fields._ 	

[[add-base-layer-to-CRU-entity-views]] 	
== Add Base Layer to CRU Entity Views

At this point you have the Map Controls to manage GEO fields. Now, you should include a base layer on your CRU entity views which displays a map to place geo data. 

Exists more than one type of base layers. At the moment, gvNIX provides you this three types: 	
 	
- http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tiles[TileLayer] 	
- http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WMS[WMS Layer] 
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Tile_Service[WMTS Layer] 	

To add a base layer to each geo field of your CRU entity views you need to execute the following commands:

[source, shell] 	
web mvc geo base layer field --controller ~.web.OwnerController --field location --url "http://maptile.maps.svc.ovi.com/maptiler/maptile/newest/satellite.day/{z}/{x}/{y}/256/png8" --type tile 
web mvc geo base layer field --controller ~.web.OwnerController --field area --url "http://maptile.maps.svc.ovi.com/maptiler/maptile/newest/satellite.day/{z}/{x}/{y}/256/png8" --type tile 
web mvc geo base layer field --controller ~.web.OwnerController --field distance --url "http://maptile.maps.svc.ovi.com/maptiler/maptile/newest/satellite.day/{z}/{x}/{y}/256/png8" --type tile 
 	
NOTE: _The **--type** option can be **tile**, **wms** or **wmts** depending on the provider service._ 

With the previous commands, you have included a tile layer on your CRU entity views like the following. 	
 	
image:images/CRU_map.png[width="80%"] 
	
	
[[add-base-layers-to-map-views]]	
== Add Base Layers to Map Views 	
 	
gvNIX provides you the possibility to display extra base layers on your map views. 	
 	
Exists more than one type of base layers. At the moment, gvNIX provides you this three types: 	
 	
- http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tiles[TileLayer] 	
- http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WMS[WMS Layer] 
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Tile_Service[WMTS Layer] 		
 	
If you want to add Tile Layer on your map views, you need to execute the following command. On this example, you are going to add a Satellit base layer from http://www.ovi.com[OVI]: 	
 	
[source, shell] 	
web mvc geo tilelayer --name satellit --url "http://maptile.maps.svc.ovi.com/maptiler/maptile/newest/satellite.day/{z}/{x}/{y}/256/png8" --index 1 --opacity 0.5 	
 	
 	
If you want to add WMS Layer on your map views, you need to execute the following command. On this example, you are going to add a _geological map of Valencia (Spain)_ from http://www.igme.es/actividadesIGME/lineas/cartoGeo.htm[IGME] 	
 	
[source, shell] 	
web mvc geo wmslayer --name "geological map of valencia" --url "http://mapas.igme.es/gis/services/Cartografia_Geologica/IGME_GeologicoCValenciana_400/MapServer/WMSServer" --format "image/png" --transparent true --version "1.1.1" --crs EPSG4326 --layers "0,1,2,3" 	
 	
NOTE: _When you add new WMS layer, you need to get it using the same projection than your current map views. If you don't do like this, you can see your wms layer on invalid map position._

NOTE: _If you add **--map** command option, you are going to add the new base layer only on the selected map instead of every map_ 	

If you want to add WMTS Layer on your map views, you need to fill the parameters of this following command.
 	
[source, shell] 	
web mvc geo wmslayer --name "" --url "" --layer ""  
 	
 	
[[add-entities-to-map-views]]	
== Add entities to Map Views 	
 	
gvNIX provides you the possibility to display entity data on your map views. 	
 	
On the https://github.com/DISID/gvnix-samples/tree/master/quickstart-geo-app#add-geo-entity-fields[third point] of this guide we added 3 new geo fields on Owner entity. 	
 	
If you want to display all GEO entities on every maps, you need to execute the following commands: 	
 	
[source, shell] 	
web mvc geo entity all 	
 	
However, if you want to add only one geo entity to every map, you need to execute the following command: 	
 	
[source, shell] 	
web mvc geo entity add --controller ~.web.OwnerController 	
 	
NOTE: _If you want to display only one geo entity or all entities in an specific map, you can use **--map** param selecting the map where you want to display them_ 	
 	
Previous commands add to your Map views Owner entity. You can display or hide its fields using checkbox as see on the next images: 	
 	
image:images/map_entities.png[width="100%"] 	
image:images/map_entity_0.png[width="100%"] 	
image:images/map_entities_1.png[width="100%"] 

 	
[[add-tools-to-map-views]] 	
== Add Tools to Map Views 	
 	
By default, _as you can see on the previous images_, when you generate new map view appears a **toolbar** on bottom right position. This toolbar contains a basic **Hand Tool** that indicates that you can move the map view. 	
 	
At the moment, you can add two tool types using gvNIX commands: 	
 	
- **Measure Tool**: Get distances between some points. 	
- **Custom Tool**: Customize it to generate new custom tools with custom functionalities on your map view. 	
 	
If you want to add new measure tool on your map views you need to execute the next simple command: 	
 	
[source, shell] 	
web mvc geo tool measure --name measure 	
 	
If you want to add new custom tool on your map views you need to execute the following command: 	
 	
[source, shell] 	
web mvc geo tool custom --name latlng --icon fa-location-arrow --activateFunction activateLatLngTool --deactivateFunction deactivateLatLngTool --iconLibrary fa 	
 	
At now, we added new custom tool on toolbar but without any functionality. This tool will get the Latitude and Longitude from selected Point. 	
 	
To add custom functionality you need to implement **activateFunction** and **deactivateFunction** like the following: 	
 	
[source, javascript] 	
function activateLatLngTool(map, instance, element){
    var oMap = map.fnGetMapObject();
	oMap.on("click", function(e){
   	   alert(e.latlng);
  	});
}
function deactivateLatLngTool(map, instance, element){
	var oMap = map.fnGetMapObject();
	oMap.off("click");
}

NOTE: _If you add **--map** command option, you are going to add the new tool only on the selected map instead of every map_ 	

Also, you can find more tools in the **WEB-INF/tags/geo/tools** folder. To include any of these tools you need to add its tag with the required parameters to the _geo:toolbar_ tag in your **views/{mappath}/show.jspx** file. Below you can find some examples:

* Add Print Tool. 
+
[source,html]
<geo:toolbar id="ps_com_springsource_petclinic_web_Map_toolbar" z="MBw20Dq9PKNdvfzOXRO7MnYvi10=">
    ...
    <tool:print id="ps_com_springsource_petclinic_web_Map_print"/>
    ...
</geo:toolbar>

* Add Zoom Select All Tool. It zooms and places your map to display all entity geo data efficiently.
+
[source,html]
<geo:toolbar id="ps_com_springsource_petclinic_web_Map_toolbar" z="MBw20Dq9PKNdvfzOXRO7MnYvi10=">
    ...
    <tool:zoom-select-all id="ps_com_springsource_petclinic_web_Map_zoomall" />
    ...
</geo:toolbar>

* Add Action Tool. It allows you to define an action.
+
[source,html]
<geo:toolbar id="ps_com_springsource_petclinic_web_Map_toolbar" z="MBw20Dq9PKNdvfzOXRO7MnYvi10=">
    ...
    <tool:action actionFunction="showHelpMessage" icon="fa-info-circle" iconLibrary="fa" id="ps_com_springsource_petclinic_web_Map_showhelp"/>
    ...
</geo:toolbar>
+
Also, you need to define the showHelpMessage function.
+
[source,javascript]
function showHelpMessage(map, instance, element){
    alert("Show any help information");
}
 	
When you finish these steps you are going to have the following toolbar: 	
 	
image:images/toolbar.png[width="30%"] 	
 
 
[[add-overview-to-map-views]] 	
=== Add Overview to Map Views 

If you want to include an overview on any of your map views, you need to execute the following command. The **class** parameter indicates which map the overview will be added to

[source, shell] 
web mvc geo component overview --class ~.web.MapController 	

By default, this component shows all the layers added on that map view.

image:images/overview.png[width="50%"] 

NOTE: _You can select which layers are displayed by editing layers overview code in your **views/{mappath}/show.jspx** file._ 	
	
[[add-geo-components-to-map-views]] 	
=== Add Geo Components to Map Views	

There are several geo functionalities that can be added to any map view:

* https://github.com/DISID/gvnix-samples/tree/master/quickstart-geo-app#add-real-coordinates[Real Coordinates]

* https://github.com/DISID/gvnix-samples/tree/master/quickstart-geo-app#add-map-scale[Map Scale]

* https://github.com/DISID/gvnix-samples/tree/master/quickstart-geo-app#road-street-searcher[Road Street Searcher]

* https://github.com/DISID/gvnix-samples/tree/master/quickstart-geo-app#add-opactiy-layer-control[Opacity Layer Control]

NOTE: _These components are not added using commands, but you need to include them by editing your **views/{mappath}/show.jspx** file._ 

[[add-real-coordinates]]
=== Add Real Coordinates

To show the real coordinates of the mouse pointer position on a map view you need to include the next code in your **views/{mappath}/show.jspx** file:

. If your show file does not contain a _geo:component_ tag you need to add it. Include the following code inside the _geo:map_ tag:
+
[source, html] 
<geo:components id="ps_com_springsource_petclinic_web_Map_components">
</geo:components>  
+
Then, you need to add its dependency: 
+
[source, html] 
<div 
 ...
 xmlns:components="urn:jsptagdir:/WEB-INF/tags/geo/components"
 ...
version="2.0"> 

. Inside the _geo:component_ tag you need to include the coordinates tag, as is shown below:
+
[source, html] 
<geo:components id="ps_com_springsource_petclinic_web_Map_components">
   <components:coordinates id="ps_com_springsource_petclinic_web_Map_coordinates" centerInputCoordinates="true"/>
</geo:components>    

     
This component also allows to mark a position by specifing coordinates location.

image:images/coordinates.png[width="70%"]  

NOTE: _If you enable the **centerInputCoordinates** option, when you specify a location you will be placed there automatically._ 


       
[[add-map-scale]]
=== Add Map Scale

To show a map scale on a map view you need to include the next code in your **views/{mappath}/show.jspx** file:

. If your show view file does not contain a _geo:component_ tag you need to add it. Include the following code inside the _geo:map_ tag:
+
[source, html] 
<geo:components id="ps_com_springsource_petclinic_web_Map_components">
</geo:components>  
+
Then, you need to add its dependency: 
+
[source, html] 
<div 
 ...
 xmlns:components="urn:jsptagdir:/WEB-INF/tags/geo/components"
 ...
version="2.0"> 

. Inside the _geo:component_ tag you need to add the scale tag, as is shown below:
+
[source, html] 
<geo:components id="ps_com_springsource_petclinic_web_Map_components">
  <components:scale id="ps_com_springsource_petclinic_web_Map_coordinates"/>
</geo:components> 

    
[[add-street-map-searcher]]
=== Add Street Map Searcher

To include a street map searcher which locates places based on text introduced, you need to include the next code inside _geo:toolbar_ tag in your **views/{mappath}/show.jspx** file:
[source, html] 
<geo:toolbar id="ps_com_springsource_petclinic_web_Map_toolbar" z="user-managed">
    ...
    <tool:geosearch id="ps_com_springsource_petclinic_web_Map_geosearch"/>
</geo:toolbar>   

When you search a location a marker is placed on the result.

image:images/gosearch.png[width="100%"]  

[[add-opacity-layer-control]]
=== Add Opacity Layer Control 

To include a slider which manages the opacity of map layers, you need to include the next code in your **views/{mappath}/show.jspx** file:

. Inside _geo:toc_ tag you need to add a _geo:toc-toolbar_ tag.

. Include the opacity tag inside the previous _geo:toc-toolbar_ tag, as is shown below:
+
[source, html] 
<geo:toc id="ps_com_springsource_petclinic_web_Map_toc" z="YpKTYjQzut/zC96UI52ho3hliRk=">
  <geo:toc-toolbar id="ps_com_springsource_petclinic_web_Map_toc_toolbar" z="user-managed">
    <tool:opacity id="opacity_slider" z="user-managed"/>
  </geo:toc-toolbar>                     

image:images/opacity.png[width="100%"] 

[[add-tools-to-layers]]
=== Add Tools to Layers

gvNIX allows you to add new tools not only to your map view but also to your layers. If you want to include a tool on a entity field layer you need to add a tool tag inside your entity field layer tag in your **views/{mappath}/show.jspx** file.

For example, to add a zoom select tool (which places your map to display all geo field data attached to the selected layer efficiently) to a layer, you have to include this tool as is shown below:

[source,html]
<layer:entity-field field="location" id="l_com_springsource_petclinic_domain_Owner_location" ... >
   <layer-toc:tools >
      <layer-tool:zoom-select id="owner-location-zoom-select" />
   </layer-toc:tools>
</layer:entity-field>  	

image:images/layer_tools.png[width="50%"] 

[[advanced-functionalities]] 	
== Advanced Functionalities 	
 	
At this moment you have a complete gvNIX GEO application. But... _Which posibilities I have with this GEO application?_ 	
 	
Here there's some functionalities that you can implement/modify on your generated map view. 	
 	
[[filtering-map-data-using-datatables]] 	
=== Filtering Map Data using Datatables 	
 	
By default, all entities that you add to Map View are filterable. You can identify a filterable entity by the filter icon that appears on layers panel (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_contents[_TOC_]) 	
 	
image:images/filter_icon.png[width="30%"] 	
 	
With this functionality, you can filter your entity map data using his Datatable. Here's an example: 	
 	
At first, you are displaying all your _Owner_ records on map. 	
 	
image:images/filter_0.png[width="100%"] 	
 	
If you filter Datatable, you are going to show only filtered records and filter icon change as selected. 	
 	
image:images/filter_1.png[width="100%"] 	
 	
If you filter Datatable with other value, you are going to show different filtered records and filter icon change as selected. 	
 	
image:images/filter_2.png[width="100%"] 	
 	
NOTE: _You can change filter type of an entity modifying **filterType** attribute on **src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/{mappath}/show.jspx**. If you set to **auto**, when you filter datatable, Map data is going to reload automatically. If you set to **manual**, you need to refresh Map View page to display filtered data. If you set to **none** filter button disappear and get all entity records without filter._ 	
 	
[[select-map-data-using-datatables]] 	
=== Select Map Data using Datatables 	
 	
With this functionality you can select some records (_is possible to select more than one_) from Datatables and "mark as selected" on your map views as you can see on the following image: 	
 	
image:images/selection_map.png[width="100%"] 	
 	
By default this functionality is not enabled. To activate it you need to enable the entity layer selection option in your **src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/{mappath}/show.jspx** file:

[source, html] 
 <layer:entity selection="true" id="l_com_springsource_petclinic_domain_Owner" path="/owners" ...>

This functionality is compatible with Filter Map Data, you can filter your map data using Datatables and then select some record.
 	
NOTE: _You can modify selection style editing entity-field **selection attributes** on **src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/{mappath}/show.jspx**_ 	
 	
[[configure-map-data-filter]] 	
=== Configure Map Data Filter
 	
By default, if you press an entity filter icon of a map view its entity datatables is load on a new page. You can change how entity datatables are displayed by changing the propiety _showFilterOn_ to one of these values:

* Window: the entity datatables is displayed on a new page.

* Dialog: the entity datatables is load on a dialog.

* Custom: you can custumize how entity datatables is shown. 

For example, if you want to show owner datables on a dialog, you need to set _showFilterOn_ to _dialog_ in your **src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/{mappath}/show.jspx** file:

[source, html] 
 <layer:entity showFilterOn="dialog" id="l_com_springsource_petclinic_domain_Owner" path="/owners" ...>

[[group-map-markers]] 	
=== Group Map Markers 	
 	
If you have some close markers when you change zoom, gvNIX can **group** them to improve map navigation as you can see on the following image: 	
 	
image:images/grouped_markers.png[width="100%"] 	
 	
If you click on **grouped marker** map will zoom on markers area to view all markers without group. 	

By default this functionality is not enabled. To activate it you need to enable the clusterize option of your layer fields in your **src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/{mappath}/show.jspx** file:

[source, html] 
<layer:entity-field clusterize="true" field="location" id="l_com_springsource_petclinic_domain_Owner_location" .../>

[[add-marker-label]] 	
=== Add Marker Label

If you want to show information in your entity markers, you can use an entity propiety as a marker label. 

To show a propiety value in an entity marker you need to set this propierty in your **src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/{mappath}/show.jspx** file:

[source, html] 
<layer:entity-field labelingProperty="lastName" field="location" id="l_com_springsource_petclinic_domain_Owner_location" .../>
