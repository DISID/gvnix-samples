== Pre-requisites

To start with gvNIX you need:

* JDK 1.6 or JDK 1.7 ( http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html )
* Maven 3.2 or above ( http://maven.apache.org/download.html )
* Internet access so that Maven can download required dependencies

== Install Spring Tool Suite (STS)

Install STS 3.6.2. Go to https://spring.io/tools/sts/all and follow the instructions.

== Install Roo Extension

Spring Roo is not longer included on http://spring.io/tools[STS] distributions.

To include *Roo Support* on your STS, follow the next instructions:

. Open your STS IDE
. Open STS dashboard and search Spring Roo
. Install _Spring Roo (current production release)_

. Restart STS IDE

== Install gvNIX Support

Finally, install and setup _gvNIX_ as default Roo support:

. Download the latest _gvNIX_ version from http://www.gvnix.org

. Unzip downloaded file. For example, in Unix and Apple systems:
+
[source,shell]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
bash:$HOME/software$ unzip gvNIX-X.X.X-RELEASE.zip
---------------------------------------------------------------------

. After unzip the file a new folder called _gvNIX-X.X.X-RELEASE_ will be
  created (from now on we will refer to it as +$GVNIX_HOME+ instead).

. Run _STS_ and go to +Window > Preferences+.

. In the new window browse to +Spring > Roo Support+. Press +Add+ and write a
  name for the configuration, then press +Browse...+ button and navigate to
  _gvNIX_ folder (note if you have followed every single step, it should be at
  +$GVNIX_HOME+).

. Once you have selected _gvNIX_ folder, you can see _gvNIX_ version in
  +Version:+ field.

. After pressing +OK+ in parent windows you will complete _gvNIX_ installation
  in your computer.
