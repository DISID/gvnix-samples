Welcome to the gvNIX samples repository which provides you several sample 
applications for getting started with {homepage}[gvNIX]. 

Each sample is contained in its own sub directory in which you will
find a _README.adoc_ file explaining further details, e.g. how to run the 
respective sample.

Note you can run samples locally by cloning this repository and starting each 
application with +mvn tomcat:run+, but first it is recommended to 
link:INSTALL-gvNIX.adoc[install gvNIX] and then try yourself to develop the 
sample following its _README.adoc_ file.

== Additional resources

The {homepage}[gvNIX] site contains several guides in spanish that show how to 
use gvNIX.

== Bug reporting

If you find a bug in a sample, or have an enhancement request, create an issue 
for the sample.

== Contributing
